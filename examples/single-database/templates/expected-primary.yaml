# Primary Database expected values template
# Count-only validation is recommended for reliable E2E testing
# Please modify table names and counts to match your project

tables:
  # Example: Users table
  Users:
    count: 1
  
  # Example: Products table
  Products:
    count: 1

  # Add other tables as needed
  # Example:
  # TableName:
  #   count: 0  # for empty tables
  #   # or
  #   count: 5  # expected number of rows
  
  # Note: Column-level validation is available but not recommended due to:
  # - Type casting complexity (YAML int vs Spanner INT64)
  # - Race conditions in concurrent validation
  # - Maintenance overhead for exact value matching
  #
  # For advanced validation, use this format:
  # TableName:
  #   count: 2
  #   columns:
  #     ColumnName: "expected_value"
  #     NumberColumn: 123
